# ivrdemo

This is an in-development proof of concept for IVR code. 
Posted publically as a demonstration of an IVR written in PHP for Asterisk. 

This IVR requires a UtiliFlex Juice 4.x installaton to actually work, 
but the code concepts and examples here are freely sharable and useful in other applications. 

If you need a custom IVR for Asterisk contact me.
